This exercise illustrates how the human vision system can identify the outline of the objects in a scene even from low quality images.


Step 1. Create a DoG filter to emulate lateral inhibition. Apply it on the images and see the results. Experiment with different values of the parameters.

Step 2. Create oriented filters (0⁰, 45⁰, 90⁰, 135⁰) to detect oriented edges on the DoG filtered image. Examine the edge images.

Step 3. Superimpose the edge images (applying  WTA policy and normalization) to reproduce the object outlines. Comment on your findings.
